# FMCGStore_Clustering_Project

## Problem Statement:
The dataset consists of information about the purchasing behavior of 2,000 individuals from a given area when entering a physical ‘FMCG’ store. All data has been collected through the loyalty cards they use at checkout. The data has been preprocessed and there are no missing values. In addition, the volume of the dataset has been restricted and anonymised to protect the privacy of the customers. 	
You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards, you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. 

## Objective:
You want to understand the customers like who are the target customers so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.  
Complete the analysis by analyzing the characteristics of the clusters and propose a plan for budget allocation for an email marketing campaign with a budget of 500,000 USD over a period of 3 months.
