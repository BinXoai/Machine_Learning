## Problem Statement:
Banks all want to retain their customers to maintain business operations, and ABC Multinational bank also wants that.
Below is the customer data of customers at ABC Multinational Bank who have transactions and the purpose of the data will be to predict Customer Churn Rate.
Suppose you are a Data Analyst for ABC bank. BOD is trying to find out why the above problem occurs and whether users of the services will leave ABC (cancel the service) in the next few days.

## Objective:
You are asked to build a model to predict whether customers will leave or continue to use the service. It will be used by the Strategy team to estimate the number of customer churn and develop improvement plans. With the knowledge you have learned, build a Decision Tree and Random Forest model to solve the above problem.
